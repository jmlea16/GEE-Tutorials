# GEE-Tutorials
Getting started with coding in Google Earth Engine can be a daunting task. While there are a lot of resources out there to help you with this, below are a few tutorials that I have written to introduce some key concepts using worked examples and short tasks where you can apply what you have learnt.

These tutorials currently cover the basics of GEE to get people started with the Javascript API, though as time goes by I will try to add to these to cover more topics and concepts.

Those delivering courses introducing students to GEE are very welcome to use and adapt these tutorials, though if you do I would really appreciate a quick [email](mailto:j.lea@liverpool.ac.uk) to let me know!
